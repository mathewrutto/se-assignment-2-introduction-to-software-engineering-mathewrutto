Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software Engineering is  the application of  principles of engineering tools and methods in the developing and maintaining  of software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

software engineering is an engineering process that is mainly related to computers and programming and developing different kinds of applications through the use of information technology.
Software engineering differs from traditional programming in the following way:
Traditional programming focuses on writng code to work on specific scenarios or come up with specific functionalities  without consideringlife cycle  and engineering processes while software engineering entails a much more comprehensive approach that follow the stages of SDLC ie analysis, design, implementation, testing, maintenance


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

This refers to a structured process that is used to design,develop and test  quality softawares




Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

1. Requirement Phase
 During this phase, the client states requirements, specifications, expectations, and any other special requirement related to the product or software. All these are gathered by the business manager or project manager or analyst of the service providing company.
The requirement includes how the product will be used and who will use the product to determine the load of operations. All information gathered from this phase is critical to developing the product as per the customer requirements.

2. Design Phase
The design phase includes a detailed analysis of new software according to the requirement phase. This is the high priority phase in the development life cycle of a system because the logical designing of the system is converted into physical designing. The output of the requirement phase is a collection of things that are required, and the design phase gives the way to accomplish these requirements. The decision of all required essential tools such as programming language like Java, .NET, PHP, a database like Oracle, MySQL, a combination of hardware and software to provide a platform on which software can run without any problem is taken in this phase.

3.Development Phase
After the successful completion of the requirement and design phase, the next step is to implement the design into the development of a software system. In this phase, work is divided into small units, and coding starts by the team of developers according to the design discussed in the previous phase and according to the requirements of the client discussed in requirement phase to produce the desired result.

4. Testing Phase
Testing is the last step of completing a software system.  Testing determines whether the software is actually giving the result as per the requirements addressed in the requirement phase or not. The Development team makes a test plan to start the test. This test plan includes all types of essential testing such as integration testing, unit testing, acceptance testing, and system testing. Non-functional testing is also done in this phase.
If there are any defects in the software or it is not working as per expectations, then the testing team gives information to the development team in detail about the issue. If it is a valid defect or worth to sort out, it will be fixed, and the development team replaces it with the new one, and it also needs to be verified.

5. Deployment
When software testing is completed with a satisfying result, and there are no remaining issues in the working of the software, it is delivered to the customer for their use.

6. Maintenance
The maintenance phase is the last and long-lasting phase of SDLC because it is the process which continues until the software's life cycle comes to an end. When a customer starts using software, then actual problems start to occur, and at that time there's a need to solve these problems. This phase also includes making changes in hardware and software to maintain its operational effectiveness like to improve its performance, enhance security features and according to customer's requirements with upcoming time. This process to take care of product time to time is called maintenance.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Agile model follows the incremental approach, where each incremental part is developed through iteration after every timebox while Waterfall model follows a sequential design process.




Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?


	
a).	Progress -In the agile model, the measurement of progress is in terms of developed and delivered functionalities.	In the waterfall model, generally the measurement of success is in terms of completed and reviewed artifacts.
b).	Nature -	Agile model is flexible as there is a possibility of changing the requirements even after starting the development process.	On the other hand, the waterfall model is rigid as it does not allow to modify the requirements once the development process starts.
c)Customer interaction-In Agile model, there is a high customer interaction. It is because, after every iteration, an incremental version is deployed to the customer.	Customer interaction in waterfall model is very less. It is because, in a waterfall model, the product is delivered to the customer after overall development.
d)Team size-It has a small team size. As smaller is the team, the fewer people work on it so that they can move faster.	In the waterfall model, the team may consist more members.
e).	Suitability	Agile model is not a suitable model for small projects. The expenses of developing the small projects using agile is more than compared to other models.	Waterfall model works well in smaller size projects where requirements are easily understandable. But waterfall model is not suitable for developing the large projects.

Agile is best  Preferred in  Projects with dynamic requirements, where quick delivery and feedback from the clients are essential, such as startups .
Waterfall on the other hand is  Suitable for projects with clear and  unchanging requirements.



Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Requirements engineering refers to the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process. Requirement engineering provides the appropriate mechanism to understand what the customer desires, analyzing the need, and assessing feasibility, negotiating a reasonable solution, specifying the solution clearly, validating the specifications and managing the requirements as they are transformed into a working system.

The process includes;
Feasibility Study
The objective behind the feasibility study is to create the reasons for developing the software that is acceptable to users, flexible to change and conformable to established standards.
Requirement Elicitation and Analysis
Software Requirement Specification
Software Requirement Validation
Software Requirement Management


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
